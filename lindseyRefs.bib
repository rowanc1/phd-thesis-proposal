%% large scale inverse problem

@article{Yang2014,
abstract = {Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) methods are highly efficient tools for assessing the Earth's conductivity structures in a large area at low cost. However, the configuration of AEM measurements, which typically have widely distributed transmitter-receiver pairs, makes the rigorous modelling and interpretation extremely time-consuming in 3-D. Excessive overcomputing can occur when working on a large mesh covering the entire survey area and inverting all soundings in the data set. We propose two improvements. The first is to use a locally optimized mesh for each AEM sounding for the forward modelling and calculation of sensitivity. This dedicated local mesh is small with fine cells near the sounding location and coarse cells far away in accordance with EM diffusion and the geometric decay of the signals. Once the forward problem is solved on the local meshes, the sensitivity for the inversion on the global mesh is available through quick interpolation. Using local meshes for AEM forward modelling avoids unnecessary computing on fine cells on a global mesh that are far away from the sounding location. Since local meshes are highly independent, the forward modelling can be efficiently parallelized over an array of processors. The second improvement is random and dynamic down-sampling of the soundings. Each inversion iteration only uses a random subset of the soundings, and the subset is reselected for every iteration. The number of soundings in the random subset, determined by an adaptive algorithm, is tied to the degree of model regularization. This minimizes the overcomputing caused by working with redundant soundings. Our methods are compared against conventional methods and tested with a synthetic example. We also invert a field data set that was previously considered to be too large to be practically inverted in 3-D. These examples show that our methodology can dramatically reduce the processing time of 3-D inversion to a practical level without losing resolution. Any existing modelling technique can be included into our framework of mesh decoupling and adaptive sampling to accelerate large-scale 3-D EM inversions. },

@article{Haber2014,
abstract = {Airborne time-domain electromagnetic surveys are effective tools for mineral exploration and geologic mapping. 3D inversion of airborne electromagnetic data is a challenging computational problem. The size of the surveys and the spatial resolution required to adequately discretize the transmitters and receivers results in very large meshes. Solving the forward problem repeatedly on such a mesh can quickly become impractical. Fortunately, using a single mesh for both the forward and inverse problem for all of the transmitters is not necessary. The forward problem for a single source or a small group of sources can be solved on different meshes, each of which only needs to be locally refined close to the selected transmitters and receivers. Away from the selected transmitters and receivers, the mesh can be coarsened. The forward problem can then be broken into a number of highly parallel problems. Each forward modelling mesh is optimized specifically to the selected transmitters and receivers and has far fewer cells than the fine inversion mesh. Further efficiency can be gained by using stochastic Gauss–Newton methods where a stochastic approximation to the gradient, Hessian or both are used. In this paper, we present new algorithms for airborne data inversion and their implementation using a finite volume discretization on OcTree meshes. We demonstrate our approach on a large-scale synthetic versatile time-domain electromagnetic surveying data set.},

abstract = {Two automatic ways of estimating the regularization parameter in underdetermined, minimum-structure-type solutions to non-linear inverse problems are compared: the generalized cross-validation and L-curve criteria. Both criteria provide a means of estimating the regularization parameter when only the relative sizes of the measurement uncertainties in a set of observations are known. The criteria, which are established components of linear inverse theory, are applied to the linearized inverse problem at each iteration in a typical iterative, linearized solution to the non-linear problem. The particular inverse problem considered here is the simultaneous inversion of electromagnetic loop–loop data for 1-D models of both electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility. The performance of each criteria is illustrated with inversions of a variety of synthetic and field data sets. In the great majority of examples tested, both criteria successfully determined suitable values of the regularization parameter, and hence credible models of the subsurface. },
